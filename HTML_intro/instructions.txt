For this project, please install the required dependencies and modules which are listed in the requirements.txt file.

To install these requirements will isolate the project environment from the system global environment eliminating possible package conflicts.

Depending on your Operating System, you will create your virtual environment differently. Please check online to see how to create a virtual environment for your operating system.

After creating the virtual environment, you will have to run this command:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install -r reqirements.txt
    - If pip doesn't work, use pip3.

Also note that this project uses sqlite3 and for that, you will have to install globally a sqlite3 package so that you can interact with the tables and the database schema.
    - To install sqlite3, run the following command.
        sudo apt install sqlite3

Have fun with the project.
