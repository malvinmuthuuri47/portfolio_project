# Flask Hotel Portfolio Project
This project drwas its inspiration from the Hotels.ng website and hence we've created a miniature demo of the website containing sample data of hotels from which a user can login/signup and search for hotels conveniently based on price or location. This website is meant for people who are travelling for business meetings or just fun lovers making accommodation and finding a resting place easy.

The requirements for this web application can be found in the requirements.txt file that's included in this repository.

Its advised to run the requirements file on a virtual environment first before trying to run the application as this can break/tamper with the system packages and crash your Operating System in the worst case scenario.

To create a virtual environment differs depending on the Operating System you are using.
For Linux Operating system, you can create a virtual environment using the following command:<br/>
    (`python3 -m venv <preferred name of virtual environment>`)

On windows Operating system, the command is as follows:<br/>
    (`python -m venv <preferred name of virtual environment>`)

On mac, the command is as follows:<br/>
    (`python3 -m venv <prefered name of virtual environment>`)

After creating the virtual environment, you have to activate it using this command:<br/>
    (`source venv/lib/activate`)

Now install the requirements but running the following command:<br/>
    (`pip3/pip install -r requirements.txt`)

After installing the requirements, you can now run the flask app by following these simple steps:<br/>
    1. Ensure you're in the directory containg the main.py file
    2. export the flask app variable which tells flask which app you are running.
        - In this case, run the following command on the terminal.(`export FLASK_APP=main`)
    3. Now, you can run the app by using the command, (`flask run`)

Our simple slideshow explains all the technical challenges and the things we've learnt as we undertook this project. Here's the link:<br/> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eoTIYZwasp3p92nHkPhW8iF5wDp8K0gvhPRE9JOEGXE/edit?usp=sharing
